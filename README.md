Known issues:

1. Sadly, YouSee doesn't always provide the correct thumbs, but instead a dummy. I have no way of detecting this, so simply dhow the dummy instead
2. Series/Episode numbereing is a mess, and lots of times missing from YouSee. If I detect an episode, and numbering is missing, I add a dummy of S01E01
